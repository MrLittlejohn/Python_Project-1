# Python_Project-1: Insertion Sort, Binary-Search, Character Split
All code is to be created with only using the len(), append(), and range() function in mind.

## Tools Used.
1. Python 3
2. Python Shell 

Go to Python and download python 3, it will give you the minimal required tools to create beautimous works of art.


## Testing
Testing was optional, I chose not to test, so don't go looking for it.

## Functions.
All functions were to be made with certain stipulations, these are not the best, most efficient ways to write these functionalities.
In fact, they are all hidden away in some library somewhere, so I reccommend using them first.
